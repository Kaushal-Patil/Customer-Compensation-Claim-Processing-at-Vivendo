## Objective

    To improve the efficiency of the claim

## Tool used
    Power Bi
## Business Need
    1) Customer Satisfaction
    2) Operational Efficiency
    3) Data-Driven
    4) decision Making
## Data Cleaning
    Replaced missing values with median in case of numerical values, replaced data with other "text" in case of "text" missing values. 
    
    Changed format of certain columns.
## Conclusion 
    1) Divert some resources from Natal and Fortaleza to Sao Luis and Recife because former have lesser number of claims.
    
    2) Vivendo should perform investigative research as to why Natal and Fortaleza are taking long to close and have almost similar avg closing time to Sao Luis and Recife if they don't have that many amount of claims.
    
    3) If cause is vegetable we can maybe give more avg to compensate and closer sooner.
    
    4) Vivendo should focus their resources into the cases with "unknown" cause as it might be more easy to win those settlement cases than meat/ vegetable by using the reason that it might not be because of vivendo's food as the cause is unknown.
